970922
class EntryPair
class Reciprocal
changed CDSparse constructor to make "anonymous" Reciprocal Vector

970923
Entry.java:	added setEntry1(Entry ent), setEntry2(Entry ent), and entriesSet()
						methods
970924
updated Glyph
class CompositeGlyph
class SeqRangeSet
class ReciprocalSet
made EntryPair,Entry, SeqRangeSet, and ReciprocalSet subclasses of
CompositeGlyph
made SeqRange and Reciprocal subclasses of Glyph

970925
restructured Glyph hierarchy considerably (see classes)

970926
removed CDSparse class
introduced CmpFile class, rewrote parser
cleaned up glyph hierarchy, I think it's pretty clean...
Wcomp compiles, but is now lacking drawing and updating of EntryGadgets

970929
strugled with Glyph drawing and cmp file parsing
EntryGadget updating fixed (optimal way ?)

970930
Got drawing to work (more or less...)
Got started on Glyph interaction. Exons can be selected, why not others..?

971001
Fixed interactions, selection of Glyphs now behave as expected

971002
fixed parse algorith in CmpFile. Now works (?) for files with several genes
per entry, and parses complement values correctly.
Updated SeqRange to contain a complement member variable.
Updated Glyph to contain a complement member variable.
Updated Gene: draw() draws < or > in genename depending on direction.
Deleted half of my source files. Swell!

971003
Lost files were restored from backup. Updated changes since last backup.
Wrote backup script for comp directory ;-)
Implemented CoordVal class.

971006-971010
introduced CoordVal objects in Glyph hierarchy
Added scroll and zoom bars to main window
started playing with zooming

971013
inverted the zoom variable in CoordVal class and updated methods that use it.
Restored Dotter.java and Regionset.java from backup (deleted 971002 ;-)
deprecated Dotter class. Introduced DotterFile class instead.

971014
Introduced SeqRegionFactory (to implement Flyweight design pattern for SeqRange
objects)
Updated DotterFile.

971015
Implemented DotterFile.getMatches() and DotterFile.aboveCutoff()
Introduced DotterRegion and DotterRegionSet classes

971016
Tried to display DotterRegions with limited success. The offset seems to be
screwed up, and the whole sequence will show similarity to something else

971017
Introduced RegionSet class. Got highlighting to work (more ore less)

971020
Fixed positioning of Glyphs. DotterRegion obj etc now display correctly.

971021
Fixed scrolling and zooming. More or less bugg-free ;-)

971022
Fixed selection and highlighting of DotterRegion obj.
Updated RegionDialog: cancel button now removes DotterRegionSets

971023-24
Adding of Region sets to display now works. 
Introduced AttributeDialog to choose color for saved RegionSet.
Renamed promoteB to addB. Added removeB (remove code not implemented)
Fixed zooming of RegionSets
Added zoom level labels to MainWindow

971027
Implemented dubble buffering for drawing.
Added Setting menu (Coordinated scrolling and zooming)
Rough implementation of coordinated scrolling and zooming
Rough implementation of middle  and right mouse button zooming

971028
Changed name to synchro scrolling and zooming
Implemented Scale class. Displays on highest/lowest tier. Tick scale depending
on zoomlevel.
Fixed positions of tiers ((canvHeight/2)/(MAXTIER+1)) (not just MAXTIER)
Fixed selection of RegionSet. Still to remove highlight() methods!

971029
Removed highlight() methods in RegionSet and DotterRegion.
Implemented Open and Save of EntryPair. (Saving of dotterRegion slow and buggy!
Entry file names don't get updated either...)

971114
Added itemLabel to MainWindow that shows what Glyph is selected.
Fixed toString() for Glyphs
Implemented FastaFile class

971115
Implemented callDotter() in RegionSet

971119
Implemented callDotter() in Reciprocal
Improved cmp file parsing in CmpFile
Implemented efetching of entries if files aren't present
cmp files can now be read irrespective of location
Dotter now displays correct positions

971120
Implemented masking of range of FastaFile sequence
CDS and repeats masked before initializing DotterRegionSet
(NB! Still a lot of "exclude" relics left, need to clean up!)
Initializing of DotterRegionSet from initB now checks state of "exclude CDS"
checkboxes.
Implemented DotterFeatureFile class to show existing exons in dotter

971121
Added Synchro scroll and zoom bars
Removed Synchro scroll and zoom menu items
Added classes ScrollZoomDirector and ColleagueScrollbar

971124
Started implementation of scrolling using ScrollZoomDirector. Absolute scale
needed instead of fraction of seq lenght. (- seq length of longest seq to + seq
length of longest seq ?) 

971125
Worked more on scrolling and zooming. Somewhat improved...

971126
Ewan worked out a transformation function for zooming (scrollbar value <->
zoomfactor) so that fractional increase in size is linear instead of inversly
exponential. Zooming now ok. The synchro zoombar will be set to the zoomlevel of
the last active zoombar. OK?
Scrolling now better. BUT at high zoomlevels strange things happen after a bit
of synchro scrolling. Several copies of each seq appear and everything gets
f-cked up. Sequences "jump" when synch scrolling after independent scrolling.

971127
Found problem with "jumping", added setPrevVal() to updateScroll() and
updateSynchScroll(). 
Decided to change scrolling implementation. Change actual min and max values of
scrollbars to -joinLen and joinLen+canvWidth. Change these when updating SBs and
zooming. Change lineIncrement and blockIncrement when zooming. May the force be
with me....
And they were (more or less). Scrolling now almost good. max and min turned
around ( -(joinLen+canvWidth) and joinLen, resp), so X values have to be
negated which is a bit tricky. 

971128
Added Close Menu Item. Moved "Read .cmp file" MI to File menu. Added "Read .gff
file" and "Read .mgff file" menu items, both disabled, to File menu.
Cleaned up some code. 
Improved saving/opening. Now behaves mor or less as expected, except asking if
save is needed. DotterRegionSet objects now saves more efficiently,
SeqRangeFactory objects discarded on save, array of DotterPoint Vectors in
DotterFile objects discarded on save and repopulated on load. 
EntryPair files and .cmp files are now loadable from the command line.

971201
Implemented Selector class to draw marquee selecting parts of an entry. Is
subclass of SeqFeature. Is created when dragging in mw.seqCanv.
Implemented OkNoCancelDialog.
Open and Close menu items now ask if saving needed.

971202
Started on a SequenceDisplay class. Drawing needs to be fixed.
Implemented FormatSeq class to format a sequence String with numbering and
newlines.

971203
Improved the SequenceDisplay class. Now almost ok, though updating of canvas
needed (same problem as with MainWindow). Maybe setting FocusListener for the
canvases will work.
Implemented GlyphVector class. Used in EntryPair to hold several
selectedGlyphs.
Implemented multiple selection of Glyphs. Pressing middle mouse button will not
deselect previous Glyphs. Multiple selectors is not working (look at setting of
selector member in EntryPair). Dotter of two selected Glyphs not working (test
for size == 2 and call dotter)

971204
Implemented SelectorPair to hold one or two Selectors. Selection of two regions
now works. Dotter on two SeqFeature objects (eg Exon, Selector etc) now work.

971205
Fixed calling of dotter on Reciprocal and RegionSet. Also Fixed redrawing and
resetting of currentDotterRegionSet when reopening RegionDialog.

971208
Richard suggested FRESCO, FRont-End for Sequence COmparison, as a name for the
application. Good?

971209
Cleaned up some bugs, eg reseting dotterRegionSets when closing. Added utrs to
DotterFeatureFile output. 
Made wcomp.jar for fiv97 meeting

971212
Removed CommandMediator class. 
Composed a download page and a download archive.

971215
Implemented RepeatMaskerFile class that can parse RepeatMasker .RepMask files and
creates appropriate Repeat objects.
Implemented LINERepeat, SINERepeat, SimpleRepeat, and LowComplexityRepeat classes.
Added RepeatMasker Menu Item to Function menu.
Added callRepeatMasker in Entry class.
Selection of Repeat objects covered by Gene objects not working. Repeat colour not yet 
optimal. More Repeat classes needed?

971216
Changed DotterFeatureFile class to generate format 2 output, and add repeats to
features. Exons and UTRs belong to "genes" series, and Repeats to "repeats" series.
Repeats are drawn thinner.
Changed addChild() in CompositeGlyph to add children to beginning of Vector unless the
child is a Gene which gets added to the end of the Vector. This fixes problem of
selecting glyphs covered by Genes.
Added LTRRepeat and DNAtranspRepeat classes.

971219
Changed drawing of SeqFeatures so they are drawn above or below Entry line
depending on wether they are on the upper or lower strand.

980106
Creating a Wcomp obj will create a .frescotmp dir (def in UsefulConstants). Will
be emptied and deleted on quit. All tmp files that are created should be written
to this dir. Started on changing different File classes to write to the tmpdir.

980107
Naming of files ok (I think).

980108
Added GffFile class.
Added gffString() to SeqFeature, and gffLines() in EntryPair. 
Generation of .gff files now work (except that exons are written out in reverse
order)...
Started on cgff generation (cgffString() in Reciprocal and cgffLines() in
EntryPair)
Wrote Adrian Smit and asked about RepeatMasker.

980109
Added CgffFile class.
Fixed problem of reverse order printing. (Children are by default stored in
reverse order except Genes. This is to handle selection of Glyphs overlapped by
Genes. The fix is to make sure Entry and ReciprocalSet returns the features in
correct order. in the case of ReciprocalSet addChild() was overridden)
.gff and .cgff files now generated correctly (hopefully...)

Added CpG class for cpg and cpg2ace.
Added CpGIsland glyph class.
CpG.parse() adds CpGIsland's to entry
Added findCpG() to EntryPair
Missing: add CpG menu item and method

980112
Added CpG menu item & method.
Fixed tier allocation for CpGIsland.
Started on adding Show Introns menu item in Settings menu

980113
Show introns menu item implemented.
Fixed drawing only on -5000 to 5000 to prevent Xwindows from screwing up when
coordinates gets above 32K. Changed draw in SeqFeature, Entry and Scale
(more? Reciprocals?).  
(Seems to screw up scrolling. FIXED! change getPixelWidth() in Entry to
return realWidth instead of canvWidth) 

980114 
Changed Reciprocal.draw() not to draw when either feature is outside -5000 to
5000 region.SeqFeature: When checking if feature is outside drawing area
boundingRect has to be set to beginning or end of drawing area (I think...).
Drawing at high zoom levels now seems to work OK.

Added resizing of MainWindow. SeqPane and the two synchroScrollBars behave
correctly. Drawing on SeqCan NOT working properly. Related to Graphics/Image
in Wcomp? Fixed (almost)! (added updateGraphics() in Wcomp). Entries are not
spread out vertically. Fixed! changed updateGraphics() in Wcomp to update
the CoordVal objects of the entries.

Implemented choice of masking Repeats when making Region sets.

980115
Created new fresco.jar file and updated download page.

Started on javadoc documentation for all classes...

980116
Documentation...

980119
Documentation...
Did changes in ReciprocalSet: removed entry1 and entry2 members as well as some
constructors, and addReciprocal().
Changes in EntryPair constructors to create ReciprocalSet and add to children  
Let's see if it still compiles...

980120
Documentation...
Changes in SeqRange: Removed the Entry member and, all methods that deals 
with Entry
Code compiles!

980121
Fixed some minor bugs that was introduced during documentation.

980122
Added getClassName() to Glyph to get name of Glyph class without the package
name. Changed in SeqFeature and Reciprocal where necessary.

989123
Implemented Dba and AlignmentBlock classes. Calling dba works really awesome!
Still got to fix correct ranges when parsing dba output.

980126
Implemented an AlignmentDisplay that can show AlignmentBlocks in a formated way.
AlignmentBlock ranges are now ok.

980127
Added calling of dba to regionSet generation to narrow down regions to similar
block. Is working so-so. Calling Dotter on RegionSet doesn't work.... Have to
call dba on reverse strand as well...(-> reverse compl function???)

980128
Fiddled with regionSets some more, calling Dotter now works. 

980129
RegionSet now calls dba on the reverse strand as well. 
Improved AlignmentDisplay to show sequence names, start and stop coordinates,
and to handle reverese complement ranges correctly (I hope). 
For RegionSets dba is called with a range including the two flanking
DotterRegions.
Changed Dba et consortes to mask repeats in subsequences used by dba. dba does
however blow up if there are too many Ns in the sequence (mailed Ewan)

980130
Made changes to dbac.c to fix problem of N masked sequences. Masking of
subsequences and calling of dba now working.
Added "Save to file" button to AlignmentDisplay, with save implementation.
Only blocks that overlap the original DotterRegion is saved in the Dba obj for
RegionSets.
Make Dba into a Glyph? ... maybe not. Split DotterRegions into several based on
dba blocks?

980202
Added "Save to file" and "Save to Fasta file" buttons to SequenceDisplay.
DotterRegions are now added to DotterFeatureFile.
Looked at MatInspector, for calling on conserved seqs....

980203
Added setComment() to FastaFile to be able to modify the comment line when using
fasta files with some external programs that are a bit picky about the shape of
the comment line. (What a great days work!)

980205
Fixed initial updating of scrollbars. Should check that the proper values for
width and x positions get passed (realX, realWidth vs canvX, canvWidth)
Added DbaParamDialog class. Parameters for Dba set at init (almost done).

980206
Fixed a bug in RegionSet, now the proper mask Vector is passed on to Dba
constructor.
If dba alignment isn't found for query Region the original queryRegion is added
to RegionSet, and a warning is set. Warning can be checked, returned
and displayed at the appropriate place e.g. status label in MainWindow.

980211
Created new fresco.jar file, added dba src to fresco dist, created new
distribution archive and updated download page.

980212
Fixed bug in AlignmentDisplay. Newlines are no longer drawn on canvas and the
matchstring is correctly displayed and written to file.
Checked out jdk1.1.5 :-(... Graphics sucks! Fonts all screwed up!

980217
Started implementing FeatureEditDialog.

980218
More FeatureEditDialog. Layout....:-(

980219
Came to terms with GridBagLayout, finally. Got into reflection for creating
SeqFeatures, and it's working too!!
Implemented ErrorDialog.

980223
Added Remove Feature menu item to Edit menu. Removes selected feature and
reciprocal if there is one.

980224
Messed around with Fresco on orasrv1, getting dotter to work etc. Objectify
dotter calling?

980227
Got genscan working!!! Got to fix names of predicted exons with scores etc

980302
Fixed file name mess (I think) Everything should be absolute names now...

980303
Wrote DotterApplet for displaying Dotter output files. (for Steve)

980304
Fixed names of predicted SeqFeatures + score, prediction method, frame...
gff lines now more like they should be.

980306
Fixed (?) problem of byte order in dotter output files.

980212 
Fixed updating of Canvases in MainWindow, SequenceDisplay, and
AlignmentDisplay. Finally! There is no need for catching all types of events,   
instead override the paint() method for Canvas. This means Canvas should be
subclassed, but since this is the only functionality that has to be altered
this is best done by an anonymous Canvas subclass.

980317
Created cvs repository for fresco

980318
Improved Genscan parsing. Now adds suboptimal exons on higher tiers, except
exons which overlap optimal exons.
Added 'Make reciprocal' button to AlignmentDisplay.
Added DbaBlock (Glyph) class. Stores AlignmentBlock 
Genscan maskes repeats except SimpleRepeats

-980327
Added classes for alignments, NWAlign and SWAlign + Align superclass that
declares some Template Methods that subclasses have to implement, eg
doDynamicProgramming()
MenuItems for these alignments added to MainWindow.
Worked on GffParse class.

980330 
Changed Genscan parsing. Exons, but not PolyA and Promoters, are now added to a
CDS before being added to a Gene. Made minor changes in CompositeGlyph and
CompositeSeqFeature. Added addChildren() method to add a vector of child
Glyphs.

980331
First version of a reciprocal finder, ReciprocalsFinder.

980406
CoordVal: changed MAXTIERS to 10
GffParser: minor parse improvments

980407
CmpFile: changed parsing slightly. As Gene.addChild() now handles creating a CDS

option
Added RepeatMaskerSpeciesDialog class

980408

980422
Added NewDbaParamDialog and NewDba classes to be able to test out the parameters
for the new dba program.

980425
Finished adding newdba, made changes in Wcomp, MainWindow and UsefulConstants.
Still need to complile newdba for osf

980427
Added NewDba menu item to View menu in MainWindow.
Compiled dba for osf, after a minor change (-params should return all
parameters).

980428
Fixed score calculation in NewDba.

980429
Started on improving reciprocal finding.

980430
Reciprocal finding implemented with newdba, works but slow

980505

the current shell.
UsefulConstants: added REPEATMASKERPATH constant
Entry: call to RepeatMasker now includes REPEATMASKERPATH
CpG: call to cpg2ace is now includes CPGPATH

980513
GffParser: Changed parser to split lines on whitespace instead of tabs. This is
not according to the format but what many produce.
Removed Promotor (SeqFeature) class.
Added Promoter (CompositeSeqFeature) class.
Added TATA, TFBS and TrxStart classes
Genscan: Now ignores promoter prediction
RegionSet: Now uses newdba
Started on Tssw class for TFBS finding

980514

SeqFeature: removed overlap(SeqFeature)
Tssw: changed nudge to reflect changes in Glyph and SeqFeature.

980521
SeqFeature: Added getBounds(), overrides Glyph.getBounds(). Calculates bounds,
and canvX, canvY, canvHeight, canvWidth etc. This removed from draw().
Added setTier(), overrides Glyph.setTier(). Sets tier sign dependent on
coord.entryTier value. Should be called with absolute tier value, but checks
before setting to be compatible with old code (should be purged...)
Glyph: Changed overlap() again to use Rectangle.intersects().
TFBSEditDialog: Fixed bug in Remove item button behaviour.
TierDialog: Now shows, and returns, absolute tier value
CoordVal: MAXTIERS calculated from canvHeight
Entry: Added getScale() method
EntryPair: changes tier of scales in updateCoordVals() method

980522

Added Alfresco class with main function from Wcomp. To avoid name confusion
Wcomp: removed main() method.

980527

Gene: added setName() method
MainWindow: Make Gene menu item now displays dialog asking for name and tier of
gene. Added Edit gene attributes menu item, shows dialog.

980625
CompositeGlyph: changed clicked() slightly to store first CompositeGlyph clicked
and go on checking more children. Preferently returns a non-CompositeGlyph.

980706

=====================LOOOOOOONG BREAK in note writing=========================
990805
A lot of changes. Too numerous to comment on at this stage.
Things in the air: 
*Calling of methods
  Implemented CorbaMethodRunner. Not used by any methods yet. Clean up calling!!!
  Should implement InputStructGenerator ( addSeq(name, seq) and 
  addParameters(parameters) methods)
  Implement corba wrapper implementations for
    est_genome
    DBA(?)
  Change GffDataStruct interface to be able to pass along free form string data
  associated with each method (e.g. DBA alignments)
  
*Parameters
  Current situation with java.properties not satisfactory
  Work out new system using ~/.alfrescorc file, default file generated the first 
  time the program is run. See notes.rcfile





_Bugs_
Region sets are broken: clicking on a region often doesn't work....

__ToDo__ 

Improve ReciprocalFinder



fix make reciprocal button in alignment window to add a more generic object than
DbaBlock

Edit Gene menu item 
Edit Gene Dialog
	Gene name
	Add/Remove Children

View Gene mRNA
View Gene protein


Interface for Features (SeqFeatures and CompositeSeqFeatures) ? {
	predicted
	predMethod
	score
	frame
} or move these members + methods to SeqFeatures only?
====> Now in SeqFeatures only

Getting at reciprocals must be improved eg EntryPair.addReciprocal() method

Look at complement of SeqFeatures and SeqRanges 

genscan, fexh

What is EntryUpdater doing? Should it be changed

Collapsing of Introns...
Semantic zooming. Show aligned sequence at highest zoom level for exons.

(Generate .cmp file)
ErrorDialog class
Manipulate SeqFeatures(create, delete, edit). Create Reciprocals.

take a new look at drawing (Decide where to put the main drawing method)
Clean up constructor mess in SeqFeatures
(Multiple?) (sub)sequence viewer
Printing


__Blurb__
Change Entry to have File as a member (instead of filename) so the full path
can be retrieved. Change CpG constructor (path and filename not needed)

Auto-generate introns from exon structure
