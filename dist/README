This is Alfresco version 0.94. 

It runs on UNIX systems and in principle on Windows systems, although there seems to
be a problem with running analysis programs under Windows.

This version points to an unreachable CORBA server, so you will have to set up your own 
(poke around under src/alfresco/server/), or run analysis programs locally.

If you have a previous version of alfresco installed there will be an 
incompatibility for previouly saved analysis files. To be on the safe side, 
open the saved analysis with the provious version, and select save .cgff file 
from the File menu. This will create two textfiles that can be opened by this 
version of Alfresco.


INSTALLING ON A UNIX SYSTEM

To install it cd to this directory and type './install'. You will be asked
for a place to install alfresco, the default being your home directory. If you 
have root access I recomend to install it somewhere where all users can 
execute it, e.g. in /usr/local.

A start-up script named 'alfresco' will be placed in a bin directory under the 
directory you specified above. Make sure this directory is in your path, then 
type 'alfresco' to run the program.


INSTALLING ON A WINDOWS SYSTEM
Note that external methods doesn't seem to work under Windows, which makes it of
limited use. I'll try to sort this out later.
To run Alfresco you need java installed. Double clicking on the alfresco.bat file 
should do the rest.


MANUAL
There is an old manual in the manual directory (open the index.html file with a web
browser). The manual is hopefully still useful although it's a bit dated.


EXAMPLES
There are some example sequences in the example_seq directory. Opening one of the
.cmp files will open the corresponding sequence files and also display corresponding
gene features on these sequences, so you can have some colourful boxes to play
around with ;).
